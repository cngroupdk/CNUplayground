# CNUplayground

During you first week in CN you will be assigned small homeworks to improve your JS skills.
As a first step create you branch under this repository. Then upload the solutions for each of the assigned task as a `*.js` file inside your branch. Every morning we will meet at 9:15 at standup corner Mezzanin to discuss your solutions and possible improvements/tips/background/theory and answer your questions.

## Screeps

Goal is to go through training excercises for screeps game. Then launch simulation room and try to do the tasks listed below.

Please note that simulation mode is not persisting state between tab reloads / closing. It will persist code, but the simulation progress will be deleted. Keep the tab open :) Also please make screenshots when you achieve the goals, so we avoid any accidents :)

[Tutorial + simaltion room](https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim)
[Documentation](https://docs.screeps.com/)
[API reference](https://docs.screeps.com/api/)

* Build a screep using 500 energy
* Make a use of container
* Optimize usage of resources and screeps - minimum iddle times and waiting lines
* Build a road to bottom right resource
* Optimize building algorithm - build closest
* Defeat the spawned invader in bottom left corner
